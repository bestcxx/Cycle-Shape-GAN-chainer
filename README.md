# demo program of Cycle-Shape-GAN using chainer  
literature:  
Translating and Segmenting Multimodal Medical Volumes with Cycle- and Shape-Consistency Generative Adversarial Network(https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09655)  

# dependency  
I confirmed operation only with..  
1)python 3.5.3  
2)chainer 3.3.0  
3)cupy 2.3.0  
4)Pillow 5.0.0  

I cannot find MRI or CT images with annotation in internet, so I use cityScape dataset.  
So, I modified several points to adapt that dataset...3d-conv to 2d-conv...etc
